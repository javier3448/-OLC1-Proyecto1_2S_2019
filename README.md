An interpreter and editor for the Usac Front End framework (UFE), a """React-like""" toolkit that consists of:
* miniHTML interpreter
* miniCSS interpreter
* UFE interpreter 

UFE is a very limited dynamically typed programming language that specifies the `render` methods of each UFE component.
Each `render` function returs an UFEX expression, miniHTML code with embedded UFE expressions. Similar to JSX in React.
